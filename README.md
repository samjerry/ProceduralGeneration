# Procedural Generation

In this assignment I made an open world level generator in Unreal Engine 4 using Levels.

## Features
- Blueprints
- Unreal Engine 4

## Software analysis 
For this assignment I had a choice between multiple engines. 
After some thinking and researching I found that Unity3D and Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) were my best two options.
Finally I decided to go with UE4 because:
Unity’s capabilities are far higher than the games that represent it, but even when taken to its limits, it’s still a tad weaker and slower than Unreal Engine.

## Learning Goals 
- How to use the UE4 engine
- How to make stuff using Blueprints in UE4
- How does one create a random level

## Planning (how does one fill in this table?!)
